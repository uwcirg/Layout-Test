						<p>This PRO Implementation Toolkit was assembled by the PROgress study team from the University of Washington and ViiV Healthcare and reviewed by the PROgress Study Steering Group. The purpose of this document is to provide practical insights gathered from the implementation of PROs in routine HIV care to support those who may be considering this process.</p>
						<p>PROgress is a research workstream entitled: Improving HIV care through the implementation of PROs within routine patient management. This is comprised of three complementary components:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>An implementation science research study (The PROgress Study), integrating PROs into two HIV clinical care settings in order to identify the essential program elements that can improve the sustainable adoption and implementation of PROs into routine HIV care. This study was designed to examine the added value of implementing PROs into routine HIV care for the salient stakeholders, including the patient, the providers, and other clinic staff. It is generating evidence of the value, barriers and facilitators involved in PRO integration in community settings.<a href="">[Add link to PROgress website, or web address for text version]</a></li>
							<li>An Evidence Review and Summary, which is designed to raise awareness of the evidence relating to PROs in the care of PLWH and to outline the potential for well implemented instruments within routine care. It draws on evidence from published literature characterizing the impact of PROs in routine clinical care for patients with chronic comorbidities including HIV-related literature as well as other fields, particularly oncology. <a href="">[Add Link]</a></li>
							<li>This PRO Implementation Toolkit, which is a resource for those considering implementing PROs in clinical HIV care. This is designed to provide practical advice to support the introduction of clinical PRO assessments into routine HIV care. These insights draw from a range of sources, including practical experience integrating PROs into HIV clinical care at multiple sites, including the PROgress sites, published literature, and additional primary interviews with stakeholders with experience integrating PROs into HIV clinical care. This toolkit was designed to help provide resources, tips, and learning to help implement PROs adapted as needed for individual clinics.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>The PRO Implementation Toolkit and Evidence Review Summary serve as complimentary resources with the Toolkit designed to provide practical hands-on approaches and the Evidence Summary designed to summarize available real-world evidence supporting the integration of PROs within routine HIV clinical care settings with each informing the other.</p>

						<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
						<h3>What is a PRO?</h3>
						<p>A patient-reported measure or outcome (PRO, also less commonly known as PROM) is defined as “any report of the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient without interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or anyone else”<sup><a href="#REF">6</a></sup>. PROs provide the patient perspective of the effects of disease and treatment including comprehensive assessment of factors such as mental health symptoms like depression/anxiety; well-being and satisfaction; health behaviors such as medication adherence; risk behaviors such as substance use and sexual risk behavior; as well as other social determinants of health and practical or safety information such as housing status and intimate partner violence.</p>
						<h3>How PROs integrate into clinic flow</h3>
						<p>What might the end result of PRO integration into care look like? How will it fit into existing clinic flow? The example below, based on clinical integration of PROs in the PROgress Study in two HIV care clinics, provides an overview of what happens- and when.</p>
						<p><b>Figure 1. PRO implementation example in HIV clinical care</b></p>
						<h3>Evolution of PROs in care</h3>
						<p>While historically PROs have had a much larger role in research than care, the use of PROs in clinical care has been increasing as a result of several key developments. These include the rapid progression of technological infrastructure leading to the expanded incorporation of touch-screen tablets, internet-based applications, and electronic health records (EHRs) in clinical care<sup><a href="#REF">7</a></sup>. Furthermore, PROs are increasingly demanded by regulators, payers, accreditors, professional organizations, and providers to measure and address PRO-related outcomes at the level of the patient, clinic, and healthcare system as well as provide population information<sup><a href="#REF">7</a></sup>. Legislative demands to improve healthcare outcomes without increasing costs has put more emphasis on quality of care, value-based reimbursement and patient engagement. As such, PROs have been increasingly identified as the most direct and relevant measure to demonstrate high-quality patient-centered care<sup><a href="#REF">7</a></sup>. The most common reasons cited for implementing PROs in clinical care among stakeholders who have already implemented them included screening, monitoring, treatment evaluation and treatment planning, and quality improvement including that mandated by external agencies<sup><a href="#REF">1</a></sup>. Other reasons cited in interviews of respondents from a range of health care settings in which PROs had been implemented included shared-decision making between patients and providers, and, less often, reasons related to satisfaction or reimbursement<sup><a href="#REF">1</a></sup>.</p>
						<h3>Relevance of PROs to modern HIV care</h3>
						<p>Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) over the past decades have increased the life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH) and transformed HIV from a fatal disease to a chronic manageable condition8. The associated decline in mortality since ART has been introduced has led to increased emphasis on managing quality of life and comorbidities, including those associated with HIV and its treatment. Many of the symptoms, health behaviors, and life circumstances associated with living with HIV and these comorbidities are not directly observable and are more easily measured by direct patient report. Yet, many such variables are under-addressed and not measured well in clinical care: in HIV care, examples include antiretroviral medication adherence, substance use, sexual risk behavior, and depression<sup><a href="#REF">9</a></sup>. Reasons for this have included social desirability bias, time constraints, limited communication skills to convey symptoms or feelings, or linguistic and/or cultural barriers<sup><a href="#REF">10-13</a></sup>. PROs help address these barriers. On-site PRO collection prior to routine clinical care appointments, via hand-held computer tablets with real-time results available to providers during clinic visits, has improved provider ability to detect and address depression/suicidal ideation, inadequate antiretroviral (ART) adherence, and substance use in HIV care<sup><a href="#REF">9,14</a></sup>. Integrating PROs into clinical care of patients with chronic conditions, such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and HIV, have been shown to be acceptable to patients and providers and valuable in clinical care<sup><a href="#REF">14-16</a></sup>; they have improved patient-provider communication<sup><a href="#REF">17-21</a></sup> and increased patient satisfaction with care<sup><a href="#REF">20,22-24</a></sup>.</p>
						<h3>Evidence-based support for PROs in HIV Care</h3>
						<p>PROs have been highly useful to providers and acceptable to patients. An in-depth review of evidence details this here <a href="">[add Dossier link]</a> and supports the idea that implementing PROs in HIV care can:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Improve detection of health behaviors, symptoms, and mental health issues.</li>
							<li>Increase provider awareness and interventions to address depression, drug and alcohol use, intimate partner violence, and other domains in order to improve health outcomes.</li>
							<li>Improve patient-provider communication, by helping patients prioritize and raise concerns, and by helping providers identify and initiate discussion of less-observable issues and/or discussion of topics that are highly sensitive or personal to the patient (e.g., depression, substance use, sexual risk behavior).</li>
							<li>Improve delivery of care, for example, allow providers to focus on the most relevant issues during the visit, increase referrals, more closely monitor treatment, and improve symptom management.</li>
							<li>Improve outcomes such as depression scores and symptom burden.</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>Toolkit purpose</h3>
						<p>This Toolkit provides practical advice to support the introduction of clinical PRO assessments into routine HIV care. These insights draw from a range of sources, including practical experience integrating PROs into HIV clinical care at multiple sites, published literature, and interviews with stakeholders with experience integrating PROs into HIV clinical care. While some of the information in this Toolkit applies to all formats of PRO assessment, we focus on implementation of tablet-based patient self-administered PRO assessments in clinical care due to the clear advantages outlined in <a href="">Chapter 3 [add Chapter 3 link]</a>. Given differences between HIV clinics, a one-size-fits-all approach to PRO integration is unlikely to fit every clinic’s needs. With this in mind, this toolkit provides resources, tips, and effective practices to help implement PROs adapted as needed for individual clinics.</p>

						<h3>Chapter overview: steps toward implementation</h3>
						<p>Though the process of PRO implementation is iterative, the chapters of this Toolkit sequence tasks into a general chronologic order starting with planning and decision-making (Chapters 1-3), then implementation (Chapters 4-6), and finally ongoing collection, maintenance, evaluation and improvement (Chapter 7).</p>
						<p>Chapter 1 helps assess and improve a clinic’s readiness for PRO implementation.</p>
						<p>Chapter 2 offers a pathway for stakeholder engagement. </p>
						<p>Chapter 3 itemizes steps needed in order to build technical infrastructure for electronic data collection. </p>
						<p>Chapter 4 operationalizes important steps to create a PRO assessment that best suits the needs of an individual HIV clinic and its patients. </p>
						<p>Chapter 5 outlines the decisions and protocols to support integration and ongoing success. </p>
						<p>Chapter 6 offers insight into initial and ongoing staff training needs. </p>
						<p>Chapter 7 provides strategies for monitoring, evaluating and sustaining the success of integration of PROs into clinical HIV care.</p>

						<h3>How this Toolkit was developed</h3>
						<p>Evidence and practical tips found in this Toolkit are drawn from real-world PRO implementation experiences and data collected from:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>The PROgress study, a ViiV-funded project evaluating impact, effectiveness, and sustainability of PRO collection in routine clinical HIV care at Midway Specialty Care in Ft. Pierce, FL, and St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, ON. The study and Toolkit were developed in conjunction with a Steering Committee comprised of HIV care providers, people living with HIV (PLWH), and HIV care researchers.</li>
							<li>The Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), a network of 8 U.S. HIV clinics. As of early 2020, >85,000 clinical PRO assessments had been completed by >20,000 PLWH across CNICS sites as part of routine clinical care visits to improve care and facilitate research on health domains important to long-term outcomes among PLWH. </li>
						</ol>
						<h3>Language</h3>
						<p>There are a number of acronyms throughout this toolkit. They are defined in Appendix 1. We also define terms that may be unfamiliar or whose meaning differs by context with use. For example, we use the term provider to refer to the physician, fellow, nurse practitioner, physician assistant or other clinician who is providing patient care. We realize in different contexts, terms such as provider have broader or narrower meaning.</p>

						<h2 id="chapter1">CHAPTER 1. ASSESSING AND IMPROVING READINESS TO IMPLEMENT PROs IN HIV CLINICAL CARE</h3>
						
						<h3>Are PROs right for my clinic right now? If not, how do we get there?</h3>
						<p>The appropriateness and readiness of PRO integration in your clinic depends on many factors, including the patient population, needs and perceptions of clinic leadership and providers, logistics, technical capacity, and cost. The tool below is designed to help you assess and improve the feasibility of integrating PROs in your clinic within each of these dimensions, by helping envision how to overcome barriers.</p>
						
						<h3>Patient population:</h3>
						<p>Does the majority of the clinic patient population possess literacy skills to read at the 6th grade level?</p>
						<a class="button fit">Yes</a>
						<a onclick="toggle_visibility_id('q1');" class="button fit">No</a>

						<p class="box" id="q1">If “<b>no</b>” (or unsure): PROs that are based on text only may be appropriate for only a subset of the population. An enhancement to text is use of a pre-recorded voice to help guide patients through a brief set of PROs. While this has advantages if reading levels are low, it adds a great deal of time/patient burden to the assessment and therefore should be considered only if needed or only for those patients who need it.</p>
						<p>Does the majority of the clinic patient population possess the cognitive and physical capacity to complete a brief PRO assessment?</p>
						<p class="box">If “<b>no</b>”: self-administered PROs may be less appropriate for these patients, and time may be better spent eliciting verbal self-report or the report of caretakers. Clinic staff may need a consistent means of distinguishing these patients from those with the ability to self-administer PROs. Of note, the ability to complete a brief PRO assessment on a tablet has been found to be feasible in many patient populations including the elderly (particularly if no mouse or keyboard as in tablets)<sup><a href="#REF">25,26</a></sup> and broadly among diverse populations of PLWH<sup><a href="#REF">27,28</a></sup>. This is often much more feasible than expected.</p>
						
						<h3>Clinic leadership:</h3>
						<p>Is the clinic’s leadership likely to support the implementation of PROs?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no”: consider what is driving this perceived lack of support. What are the clinic leadership’s key goals and priorities, and what evidence regarding the use of PROs may align with them? Leadership typically supports PRO implementation for a variety of reasons including improving patient care, better assessing needs, and enabling better data collection for administrative tasks such as mandated reporting and quality assurance from external agencies (See Chapter 2, “Engage Stakeholders”). [Add Link to Chapter 2 here]</p>
						<p>Is there an individual or individuals on staff that can generate stakeholder interest in PRO collection and champion PROs as a priority? Stakeholder support or clinic champions have been shown to be useful for successful integration of PROs in clinical care.6</p>
						<p class="box">If “no”: see Chapter 2, “Engage Stakeholders” which offers support for illustrating the benefits of PROs in clinical care. [Add Link to Chapter 2 here]</p>
						<p>Is there an individual or individuals on staff that can champion PRO data collection with respect to managing day-to-day operations?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no”: consider what steps would be needed to identify such an individual or allot time in an existing individual’s duties that would be accountable for the ongoing success of this operation. For example, this individual may supervise front desk staff, or may be a designated medical assistant.</p>

						<h3>Providers:</h3>
						<p>Are clinic providers supportive of the use of PRO measures in clinical care?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no”: consider the basis for this. What are their perceptions of the value of PROs? What experiences form their basis for the lack of support? What are their concerns (see Chapter 2’s section, “Address Common Concerns”)? Have your providers had negative experiences with PROs? To what extent are these concerns still relevant in the context of brief tablet-based PRO collection? Provider concerns often focus on potential impact on clinic flow or visit length. Does focusing on specific domains that may be particularly relevant for improving care in a clinical setting but otherwise are assessed poorly such as substance use or intimate partner violence impact support? Does focusing on a brief assessment with plans to implement in such a way to minimize impact on flow minimize these concerns?</p>
						<p>Has their response to changes in prior clinic protocols been positive?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no”: identify what is driving this. To what extent may the evidence supporting the benefits of PROs in terms of improving clinical care ameliorate these concerns? [Add Link to Chapter 2 here]</p>

						<h3>Logistics and flow:</h3>
						<p>Is there a plan as to how the clinic can allot time at the beginning of the visit for patients to take a PRO assessment without disrupting flow?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no”: do opportunities exist to collect information from patients while they are waiting for their provider? Do opportunities exist for patients to complete PROs prior to the appointment, off-site, using personal electronic devices? While this can lessen the impact on clinic flow, as a stand-alone approach it excludes patients who lack such devices. It may however be useful as a supplementary approach to within-clinic PRO collection to decrease impact on clinic flow. This may be a particularly useful approach in care settings with Telehealth visits, an increasingly common practice as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. See Chapter 5, “Outline Workflow”. [Add Link to Chapter 5 here]</p>
						<p>Does the clinic have a plan to allot space on-site for patients to take a PRO assessment?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no”: can patients complete the PROs while they are waiting for their provider’s in the examination rooms? Do opportunities exist for patients to complete PROs prior to the appointment, off-site, using personal electronic devices? While this cannot replace in-person PROs, as many patients do not have the resources to complete PROs off-site, it may decrease the numbers of patients completing PROs in the clinic setting. See Chapter 5, “Outline Workflow”. [Add Link to Chapter 5 here]</p>

						<h3>Technical capacity:</h3>
						<p>Does the clinic possess the technical capacity to support electronic data collection?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no” or “not sure”: see Chapter 3, “Building Technical Infrastructure”. [Add Link to Chapter 3 here]</p>

						<h3>Cost:</h3>
						<p>Can my clinic afford the resources necessary, such as the staff time and electronic equipment (e.g., iPads or other tablets)?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no” or “not sure”, see the section detailing startup and recurring costs, below, bearing in mind that equipment costs change over time and are decreasing at the time of this writing.</p>

						<h3>Startup and recurring costs</h3>
						<p>Understanding the financial costs associated with implementing PROs is fundamental to long-term success. There are different types of costs to consider: initial start-up (or one-time capital costs), and recurring fixed costs.</p>
						<p>Start-up costs bring a project to operational status (e.g., software development, purchase of office equipment, licenses, etc.). These costs incur at the beginning of the project or at a single point in time, and not as a year-to-year or month-to-month expense.</p>
						<p>Table 1 contains some of the start-up costs to consider when developing a program budget.</p>
						<div class="table-wrapper">

						</div>

						<p>Of note, many of the costs (e.g. internet) do not necessarily apply to many clinical settings as these resources are already available. Personnel are likely the most important component of costs in most clinics whether it is adding new staff or shuffling duties. IT costs can include platform development vs. integration of existing platforms (several are available as Shareware but still will require programming (see Chapter 3).  [Add Link to Chapter 3 here]</p>

						<p>Recurring costs occur on a regular basis, and typically fall within an annual budget period. Unlike one-time costs, recurring costs generally remain the same within the budget year (e.g., general administrative costs, rent, license renewal, etc.). However, normal price increases (e.g., rent increases, pay raises, or other cost-of-living increases) should be budgeted for each coming year. Again, many of these will not apply to many clinic settings however personnel considerations are key. Table 2 shows examples of recurring costs.</p>

						<p>Of note, many of these costs do not apply in most clinical care settings (e.g. communication costs in most clinics do not apply as phone and internet resources already exist and do not include incremental additional costs when adding programs). Personnel likely is the most significant of cost in most clinical care settings even when some tasks are integrated into existing roles such as the front desk staff.</p>

						<h3>Sample cost itemization tool</h3>
						<p>Below is an itemization of startup and maintenance costs for integrating and administering PROs. Enter costs in the left hand column to determine:</p>
						<p>Fixed Costs</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Device or devices (e.g. iPads or other tablets). You may wish to purchase more than one device in order to administer PROs to more than one patient at a time</li>
							<li>Printer, if PRO results are printed out (printer is not a cost if integrated into electronic health record (EHR) or presented to provider on screen at start of visit)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Recurring costs in 1 year</p>
						<ul>
							<li>WiFi access (monthly fee X 12 months)</li> 
							<li>Paper, 1 page of PRO results per patient (no cost if electronic) multiplied by number of visits for which PROs are administered in a year</li>
							<li>Toner for printer. Number of cartridges needed depends on number of PROs administered. A standard cartridge prints 220 pages </li>
							<li>Salary associated with % FTE for staff member setting up and overseeing use of tablets. In the PROgress study, staff estimated a maximum of 4 minutes per patient for explanation of procedure, setup, collection of device, and delivery of paper–based results</li>
						</ul>

						<p>One of the biggest issues that lead to delays and practical barriers including unplanned costs with PRO implementation involves integration with the EHR. Creating new platforms can be expensive and time consuming, integrating with EHRs is sometimes not feasible and the burden of the slow and/or complex EHR control processes have been noted as a hurdle3. This is even before taking into account the frequent changes in EHR products that are occurring across many healthcare settings.</p>
						<p>Practical tip: A plan regarding technical approaches (Chapter 3) is important before realistic costs estimates can be conducted. EHR-based approaches are not necessarily the most effective (due to many PLWH not being linked to patient portals), efficient, modifiable, or practical. However, this is a quickly moving area and will need to be assessed on a site-by-site basis (Chapter 3). [Add Link to Chapter 3 here]</p>

						<h3>Creating a business case for PRO implementation</h3>
						<p>Your organization may require the development of a formal business case for PRO implementation in order to assist in identifying short and long-term goals and associated budget requirements. Needs, solutions, approaches, risk assessments, and value analyses may be included in a business case. Table 3 shows an example of this format.</p>
