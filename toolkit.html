									<!--<h3 id="toc">What Is the Purpose of the Implementation Toolkit?</h3>
									<p>This toolkit has been designed to support PRO uptake in routine HIV care by highlighting key considerations for implementers; this includes implementation insights, example materials and testimonies from stakeholders who have first-hand experience with PRO implementation, covering key areas that need to be actioned or assessed. The objective is to facilitate easier and more effective PRO use where appropriate.</p>
									<p>Much of the real world evidence and practical tips found in the Toolkit are drawn from conversations with staff from the Center for Aids Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS).  CNICS is an electronic medical records-based network of HIV clinics.  It provides a research infrastructure to support research on HIV clinical outcomes and comparative effectiveness trials.  CNICS sites include routine collection of PROs electronically as part of their clinical care (see, for example, Crane et al. 2017; Fredericksen et al. 2012; Fredericksen et al. 2016).<p>
									<h3>What Steps Are Needed for PRO Implementation?</h3>
									<p>PRO implementation involves several stages of planning and execution, as well as follow-up and assessment. Each chapter in the toolkit considers a different step in the implementation process. The order in which the steps are followed depends on the needs of the individual clinic. The chapters available in this resource are outlined below:</p>
									
									<h4><a href="#chapter1"> Chapter 1: Choosing PROs and Implementation Approaches to Meet Patient and Clinic Needs</a></h4>
									<p>The focus of this chapter is the appropriate selection of PROs based on clinic’s needs and their HIV patient population; it includes links to available PROs and a discussion of the administration, scoring, and interpretation process</p>

										</ul>
																
									<p>All chapters where possible include comments from stakeholders and practical tips from implementers.</p>
									<h3>What Other Guides Are Available?</h3>
									<p>This toolkit was developed specifically for implementation of PROs in HIV routine care. Other more general guides exist, and provide somewhat different—though useful—information. These include the “Users Guide to Implementing Patient-Reported Outcomes Assessments in Clinical Practice” by the International Society for Quality of Life Research (ISOQOL) (Version 2, 2015), and the results of a workshop held by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) in 2013.</p>
									<p>The ISOQOL guide focuses on the PROs, the types, timing of administration, score assessment and presentation and evaluation of use. The current document provides broader information on identification of stakeholders, finance, training, information technology (IT) issues, monitoring, and evaluation. The PCORI document summarizes a far-ranging workshop, and provides recommendations in areas of infrastructure/shared resources, as well as recommendations for methods and health systems.</p>-->

						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<h3>Introduction: What is a PRO?</h3>
						<p>A patient-reported measure or outcome (PRO) is defined as “any report of the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient without interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or anyone else”1. PROs provide the patient perspective of the effects of disease and treatment including comprehensive assessment of symptoms such as mental health symptoms like depression/anxiety; well-being and satisfaction; health behaviors such as medication adherence; risk behaviors such as substance use and sexual risk behavior; as well as other social determinants of health and practical or safety information such as housing status and intimate partner violence. </p>
						<h3>Evolution of PROs in care</h3>
						<p>While historically PROs have had a much larger role in research than care, the use of PROs in clinical care has been increasing as a result of several key developments. These include the rapid progression of technological infrastructure leading to the expanded incorporation of touch-screen tablets, internet-based applications, and electronic health records (EHRs) in clinical care2. Furthermore, PROs are increasingly being demanded by regulators, payers, accreditors, professional organizations, and providers to measure and address PRO-related outcomes at the level of the patient, clinic, and healthcare system as well as provide population information2. Legislative demands to improve health care outcomes without increasing costs puts more emphasis on quality of care, value-based reimbursement and patient engagement and has led to PROs increasingly be identified as the most direct and relevant measure to demonstrate high-quality patient-centered care2. The most common reasons cited for implementing PROs in clinical care among stakeholders who have already implemented them included screening, monitoring, treatment evaluation and treatment planning; and quality improvement including that mandated by external agencies3. Other reasons cited in interviews of respondents from a range of health care settings where PROs had been implemented included shared-decision making between patients and providers, and less often for reasons related to satisfaction or reimbursement3.</p>
						<h3>Relevance of PROs to modern HIV care</h3>
						<p>Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) over the past decades have increased the life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH) and transformed HIV from a fatal disease to a chronic manageable condition4. The associated decline in mortality since ART has been introduced has led to increased emphasis on managing quality of life and comorbidities, including those associated with HIV and its treatment. Many of the symptoms, health behaviors, and life circumstances associated with living with HIV and these comorbidities are not directly observable and are more easily measured by direct patient report. Yet, many such variables are under-addressed and not measured well in clinical care: in HIV care, examples include antiretroviral medication adherence, substance use, sexual risk behavior, and depression5. Reasons for this have included social desirability bias, time constraints, limited communication skills to convey symptoms or feelings, or linguistic and/or cultural barriers6-9. PROs help address these barriers. On-site PRO collection prior to routine clinical care appointments, via hand-held computer tablets with real-time results available to providers during clinic visits, has improved provider ability to detect and address depression/suicidal ideation, inadequate antiretroviral (ART) adherence, and substance use in HIV care5,10. Integrating PROs into clinical care of patients with chronic conditions, such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and HIV, have been shown to be acceptable to patients and providers and valuable in clinical care10-12; they have improved patient-provider communication13-17 and increased patient satisfaction with care16,18-20.</p>
						<h3>Evidence-based support for PROs in HIV Care</h3>
						<p>PROs have been found to be highly useful to providers and acceptable to patients. An in-depth dossier of evidence details this evidence here [add Dossier link] and supports the idea that implementing PROs in HIV care can:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Improve detection of health behaviors, symptoms, and mental health issues</li>
							<li>Increase provider awareness and interventions to address depression, drug and alcohol use, intimate partner violence, and other domains in order to improve health outcomes</li>
							<li>Improve patient-provider communication, by helping patients prioritize and raise concerns and helping providers identify and initiate areas of discussion that can be difficult to know are needed and/or difficult to initiate without the PROs (e.g., sexual risk behavior)</li>
							<li>Improve delivery of care, e.g., allow providers to focus on the most relevant issues during the visit rather than identifying the issues, improving symptom management and other care and therefore reducing emergency department visits and hospitalizations. *Note this is based on a compendium of studies in chronic disease populations: data regarding reducing hospitalizations is not based on PLWH.</li>
						</ul>
						<h3>Toolkit purpose</h3>
						<p>This Toolkit is designed to provide practical advice to support the introduction of clinical PRO assessments into routine HIV care. These insights draw from a range of sources, including practical experience integrating PROs into HIV clinical care at multiple sites, published literature, and primary interviews with stakeholders with experience integrating PROs into HIV clinical care. While some of the information in this Toolkit applies to all formats of PRO assessment, we focus on implementation of tablet-based patient self-administered PRO assessments in clinical care due to the clear advantages outlined in Chapter 3 [add Chapter 3 link]. Every HIV clinic is a little bit different so no one-size-fits all approach will allow PRO integration into every HIV clinic. Therefore, this toolkit was designed to help provide resources, tips, and learning to help implement PROs adapted as needed for individual clinics.</p>
						<h3>Chapter overview: steps toward implementation</h3>
						<p>Though the process of PRO implementation is iterative, the chapters of this Toolkit sequence tasks into a general chronologic order starting with planning and decision-making (Chapters 1-3), then implementation (Chapters 4-6), and finally ongoing collection, maintenance, evaluation and improvement (Chapter 7). Chapter 1 helps assess and improve a clinic’s readiness for PRO implementation. Chapter 2 offers a pathway for stakeholder engagement. Chapter 3 itemizes steps needed in order to build technical infrastructure for electronic data collection. Chapter 4 operationalizes important steps to create a PRO assessment that best suits the needs of an individual HIV clinic and its patients. Chapter 5 outlines the decisions and protocols to support integration and ongoing success. Chapter 6 offers insight into initial and ongoing staff training needs. Chapter 7 provides strategies for monitoring, evaluating and sustaining the success of integration of PROs into clinical HIV care.</p>
						<h3>How this Toolkit was developed</h3>
						<p>Evidence and practical tips found in this Toolkit are drawn from real-world PRO implementation experiences and data collected 1) within the PROgress study, a ViiV-funded project evaluating impact, effectiveness, and sustainability of PRO collection in routine clinical HIV care at Midway Specialty Care in Ft. Pierce, FL, and St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, ON; and 2) within the Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), a network of 8 U.S. HIV clinics. As of early 2020, >85,000 clinical PRO assessments had been completed by >20,000 patients with HIV across CNICS sites as part of routine clinical care visits to improve care and facilitate research on health domains important to long-term outcomes among PLWH. </p>
						<h3>Language</h3>
						<p>There are a number of acronyms throughout this toolkit. They are defined in Appendix 1. We also define terms that may be unfamiliar or whose meaning differs by context in Appendix 2. For example, we use the term provider to refer to the physician, fellow, nurse practitioner, physician assistant or other clinician who is providing patient care. We realize in different contexts, terms such as provider have broader or narrower meaning and therefore include a glossary.</p>

						<h2 id="chapter1">CHAPTER 1. ASSESSING AND IMPROVING READINESS TO IMPLEMENT PROs IN HIV CLINICAL CARE</h3>
						
						<h3>Are PROs right for my clinic right now? If not, how do we get there?</h3>
						<p>The appropriateness and readiness of PRO integration in your clinic depends on many factors, including the patient population, needs and perceptions of clinic leadership and providers, logistics, technical capacity, and cost. The tool below is designed to help you assess and improve the feasibility of integrating PROs in your clinic within each of these dimensions, by helping envision how to overcome barriers.</p>
						
						<h3>Patient population:</h3>
						<p>Does the majority of the clinic patient population possess literacy skills to read at the 6th grade level?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no”: PROs that are based on text only may be appropriate for only a subset of the population. An enhancement to text is use of a pre-recorded voice to help guide patients through a brief set of PROs. While this has advantages if reading levels are low, it adds a great deal of time/patient burden to the assessment and therefore should be considered only if needed or only for those patients who need it.</p>
						<p>Does the majority of the clinic patient population possess the cognitive and physical capacity to complete a brief PRO assessment?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no”: self-administered PROs may be less appropriate for these patients, and time may be better spent eliciting verbal self-report or the report of caretakers. Clinic staff may need a consistent means of distinguishing these patients from those with the ability to self-administer PROs. Of note, the ability to complete a brief PRO assessment on a tablet has been found to be feasible in many patient populations including the elderly (particularly if no mouse or keyboard as in tablets)21,22. This is often much more feasible than expected.</p>
						
						<h3>Clinic leadership:</h3>
						<p>Is the clinic’s leadership likely to support the implementation of PROs?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no”: consider what is driving this perceived lack of support. What are the clinic leadership’s key goals and priorities, and what evidence regarding the use of PROs may align with them? Leadership typically supports PRO implementation for a variety of reasons including improving patient care, better assessing needs, and enabling better data collection for administrative tasks such as mandated reporting and quality assurance from external agencies (See Chapter 2, “Engage Stakeholders”). [Add Link to Chapter 2 here]</p>
						<p>Is there an individual or individuals on staff that can generate stakeholder interest in PRO collection and champion PROs as a priority? Stakeholder support or clinic champions have been shown to be useful for successful integration of PROs in clinical care.6</p>
						<p class="box">If “no”: see Chapter 2, “Engage Stakeholders” which offers support for illustrating the benefits of PROs in clinical care. [Add Link to Chapter 2 here]</p>
						<p>Is there an individual or individuals on staff that can champion PRO data collection with respect to managing day-to-day operations?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no”: consider what steps would be needed to identify such an individual or allot time in an existing individual’s duties that would be accountable for the ongoing success of this operation. For example, this individual may supervise front desk staff, or may be a designated medical assistant.</p>

						<h3>Providers:</h3>
						<p>Are clinic providers supportive of the use of PRO measures in clinical care?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no”: consider the basis for this. What are their perceptions of the value of PROs? What experiences form their basis for the lack of support? What are their concerns (see Chapter 2’s section, “Address Common Concerns”)? Have your providers had negative experiences with PROs? To what extent are these concerns still relevant in the context of brief tablet-based PRO collection? Provider concerns often focus on potential impact on clinic flow or visit length. Does focusing on specific domains that may be particularly relevant for improving care in a clinical setting but otherwise are assessed poorly such as substance use or intimate partner violence impact support? Does focusing on a brief assessment with plans to implement in such a way to minimize impact on flow minimize these concerns?</p>
						<p>Has their response to changes in prior clinic protocols been positive?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no”: identify what is driving this. To what extent may the evidence supporting the benefits of PROs in terms of improving clinical care ameliorate these concerns? [Add Link to Chapter 2 here]</p>

						<h3>Logistics and flow:</h3>
						<p>Is there a plan as to how the clinic can allot time at the beginning of the visit for patients to take a PRO assessment without disrupting flow?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no”: do opportunities exist to collect information from patients while they are waiting for their provider? Do opportunities exist for patients to complete PROs prior to the appointment, off-site, using personal electronic devices? While this can lessen the impact on clinic flow, as a stand-alone approach it excludes patients who lack such devices. It may however be useful as a supplementary approach to within-clinic PRO collection to decrease impact on clinic flow. This may be a particularly useful approach in care settings with Telehealth visits, an increasingly common practice as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. See Chapter 5, “Outline Workflow”. [Add Link to Chapter 5 here]</p>
						<p>Does the clinic have a plan to allot space on-site for patients to take a PRO assessment?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no”: can patients complete the PROs while they are waiting for their provider’s in the examination rooms? Do opportunities exist for patients to complete PROs prior to the appointment, off-site, using personal electronic devices? While this cannot replace in-person PROs, as many patients do not have the resources to complete PROs off-site, it may decrease the numbers of patients completing PROs in the clinic setting. See Chapter 5, “Outline Workflow”. [Add Link to Chapter 5 here]</p>

						<h3>Technical capacity:</h3>
						<p>Does the clinic possess the technical capacity to support electronic data collection?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no” or “not sure”: see Chapter 3, “Building Technical Infrastructure”. [Add Link to Chapter 3 here]</p>

						<h3>Cost:</h3>
						<p>Can my clinic afford the resources necessary, such as the staff time and electronic equipment (e.g., iPads or other tablets)?</p>
						<p class="box">If “no” or “not sure”, see the section detailing startup and recurring costs, below, bearing in mind that equipment costs change over time and are decreasing at the time of this writing.</p>

						<h3>Startup and recurring costs</h3>
						<p>Understanding the financial costs associated with implementing PROs is fundamental to long-term success. There are different types of costs to consider: initial start-up (or one-time capital costs), and recurring fixed costs.</p>
						<p>Start-up costs bring a project to operational status (e.g., software development, purchase of office equipment, licenses, etc.). These costs incur at the beginning of the project or at a single point in time, and not as a year-to-year or month-to-month expense.</p>
						<p>Table 1 contains some of the start-up costs to consider when developing a program budget.</p>

						</div>

						<p>Of note, many of the costs (e.g. internet) do not necessarily apply to many clinical settings as these resources are already available. Personnel are likely the most important component of costs in most clinics whether it is adding new staff or shuffling duties. IT costs can include platform development vs. integration of existing platforms (several are available as Shareware but still will require programming (see Chapter 3).  [Add Link to Chapter 3 here]</p>

						<p>Recurring costs occur on a regular basis, and typically fall within an annual budget period. Unlike one-time costs, recurring costs generally remain the same within the budget year (e.g., general administrative costs, rent, license renewal, etc.). However, normal price increases (e.g., rent increases, pay raises, or other cost-of-living increases) should be budgeted for each coming year. Again, many of these will not apply to many clinic settings however personnel considerations are key. Table 2 shows examples of recurring costs.</p>

						<p>Of note, many of these costs do not apply in most clinical care settings (e.g. communication costs in most clinics do not apply as phone and internet resources already exist and do not include incremental additional costs when adding programs). Personnel likely is the most significant of cost in most clinical care settings even when some tasks are integrated into existing roles such as the front desk staff.</p>

						<h3>Sample cost itemization tool</h3>
						<p>Below is an itemization of startup and maintenance costs for integrating and administering PROs. Enter costs in the left hand column to determine:</p>
						<p>Fixed Costs</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Device or devices (e.g. iPads or other tablets). You may wish to purchase more than one device in order to administer PROs to more than one patient at a time</li>
							<li>Printer, if PRO results are printed out (printer is not a cost if integrated into electronic health record (EHR) or presented to provider on screen at start of visit)</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Recurring costs in 1 year</p>
						<ul>
							<li>WiFi access (monthly fee X 12 months)</li> 
							<li>Paper, 1 page of PRO results per patient (no cost if electronic) multiplied by number of visits for which PROs are administered in a year</li>
							<li>Toner for printer. Number of cartridges needed depends on number of PROs administered. A standard cartridge prints 220 pages </li>
							<li>Salary associated with % FTE for staff member setting up and overseeing use of tablets. In the PROgress study, staff estimated a maximum of 4 minutes per patient for explanation of procedure, setup, collection of device, and delivery of paper–based results</li>
						</ul>

						<p>One of the biggest issues that lead to delays and practical barriers including unplanned costs with PRO implementation involves integration with the EHR. Creating new platforms can be expensive and time consuming, integrating with EHRs is sometimes not feasible and the burden of the slow and/or complex EHR control processes have been noted as a hurdle3. This is even before taking into account the frequent changes in EHR products that are occurring across many healthcare settings.</p>
						<p>Practical tip: A plan regarding technical approaches (Chapter 3) is important before realistic costs estimates can be conducted. EHR-based approaches are not necessarily the most effective (due to many PLWH not being linked to patient portals), efficient, modifiable, or practical. However, this is a quickly moving area and will need to be assessed on a site-by-site basis (Chapter 3). [Add Link to Chapter 3 here]</p>

						<h3>Creating a business case for PRO implementation</h3>
						<p>Your organization may require the development of a formal business case for PRO implementation in order to assist in identifying short and long-term goals and associated budget requirements. Needs, solutions, approaches, risk assessments, and value analyses may be included in a business case. Table 3 shows an example of this format.</p>
