						<p>This PRO Implementation Toolkit was assembled by the PROgress study team from the University of Washington and ViiV Healthcare and reviewed by the PROgress Study Steering Group. The purpose of this document is to provide practical insights gathered from the implementation of PROs in routine HIV care to support those who may be considering this process.</p>
						<p>PROgress is a research workstream entitled: Improving HIV care through the implementation of PROs within routine patient management. This is comprised of three complementary components:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>An implementation science research study (The PROgress Study), integrating PROs into two HIV clinical care settings in order to identify the essential program elements that can improve the sustainable adoption and implementation of PROs into routine HIV care. This study was designed to examine the added value of implementing PROs into routine HIV care for the salient stakeholders, including the patient, the providers, and other clinic staff. It is generating evidence of the value, barriers and facilitators involved in PRO integration in community settings.<a href="">[Add link to PROgress website, or web address for text version]</a></li>
							<li>An Evidence Review and Summary, which is designed to raise awareness of the evidence relating to PROs in the care of PLWH and to outline the potential for well implemented instruments within routine care. It draws on evidence from published literature characterizing the impact of PROs in routine clinical care for patients with chronic comorbidities including HIV-related literature as well as other fields, particularly oncology. <a href="">[Add Link]</a></li>
							<li>This PRO Implementation Toolkit, which is a resource for those considering implementing PROs in clinical HIV care. This is designed to provide practical advice to support the introduction of clinical PRO assessments into routine HIV care. These insights draw from a range of sources, including practical experience integrating PROs into HIV clinical care at multiple sites, including the PROgress sites, published literature, and additional primary interviews with stakeholders with experience integrating PROs into HIV clinical care. This toolkit was designed to help provide resources, tips, and learning to help implement PROs adapted as needed for individual clinics.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>The PRO Implementation Toolkit and Evidence Review Summary serve as complimentary resources with the Toolkit designed to provide practical hands-on approaches and the Evidence Summary designed to summarize available real-world evidence supporting the integration of PROs within routine HIV clinical care settings with each informing the other.</p>

						<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
						<h3>What is a PRO?</h3>
						<p>A patient-reported measure or outcome (PRO, also less commonly known as PROM) is defined as “any report of the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient without interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or anyone else”<sup><a href="#REF">6</a></sup>. PROs provide the patient perspective of the effects of disease and treatment including comprehensive assessment of factors such as mental health symptoms like depression/anxiety; well-being and satisfaction; health behaviors such as medication adherence; risk behaviors such as substance use and sexual risk behavior; as well as other social determinants of health and practical or safety information such as housing status and intimate partner violence.</p>
						<h3>How PROs integrate into clinic flow</h3>
						<p>What might the end result of PRO integration into care look like? How will it fit into existing clinic flow? The example below, based on clinical integration of PROs in the PROgress Study in two HIV care clinics, provides an overview of what happens- and when.</p>
						<p><b>Figure 1. PRO implementation example in HIV clinical care</b></p>
						<h3>Evolution of PROs in care</h3>
						<p>While historically PROs have had a much larger role in research than care, the use of PROs in clinical care has been increasing as a result of several key developments. These include the rapid progression of technological infrastructure leading to the expanded incorporation of touch-screen tablets, internet-based applications, and electronic health records (EHRs) in clinical care<sup><a href="#REF">7</a></sup>. Furthermore, PROs are increasingly demanded by regulators, payers, accreditors, professional organizations, and providers to measure and address PRO-related outcomes at the level of the patient, clinic, and healthcare system as well as provide population information<sup><a href="#REF">7</a></sup>. Legislative demands to improve healthcare outcomes without increasing costs has put more emphasis on quality of care, value-based reimbursement and patient engagement. As such, PROs have been increasingly identified as the most direct and relevant measure to demonstrate high-quality patient-centered care<sup><a href="#REF">7</a></sup>. The most common reasons cited for implementing PROs in clinical care among stakeholders who have already implemented them included screening, monitoring, treatment evaluation and treatment planning, and quality improvement including that mandated by external agencies<sup><a href="#REF">1</a></sup>. Other reasons cited in interviews of respondents from a range of health care settings in which PROs had been implemented included shared-decision making between patients and providers, and, less often, reasons related to satisfaction or reimbursement<sup><a href="#REF">1</a></sup>.</p>
						<h3>Relevance of PROs to modern HIV care</h3>
						<p>Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) over the past decades have increased the life expectancy of people living with HIV (PLWH) and transformed HIV from a fatal disease to a chronic manageable condition8. The associated decline in mortality since ART has been introduced has led to increased emphasis on managing quality of life and comorbidities, including those associated with HIV and its treatment. Many of the symptoms, health behaviors, and life circumstances associated with living with HIV and these comorbidities are not directly observable and are more easily measured by direct patient report. Yet, many such variables are under-addressed and not measured well in clinical care: in HIV care, examples include antiretroviral medication adherence, substance use, sexual risk behavior, and depression<sup><a href="#REF">9</a></sup>. Reasons for this have included social desirability bias, time constraints, limited communication skills to convey symptoms or feelings, or linguistic and/or cultural barriers<sup><a href="#REF">10-13</a></sup>. PROs help address these barriers. On-site PRO collection prior to routine clinical care appointments, via hand-held computer tablets with real-time results available to providers during clinic visits, has improved provider ability to detect and address depression/suicidal ideation, inadequate antiretroviral (ART) adherence, and substance use in HIV care<sup><a href="#REF">9,14</a></sup>. Integrating PROs into clinical care of patients with chronic conditions, such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and HIV, have been shown to be acceptable to patients and providers and valuable in clinical care<sup><a href="#REF">14-16</a></sup>; they have improved patient-provider communication<sup><a href="#REF">17-21</a></sup> and increased patient satisfaction with care<sup><a href="#REF">20,22-24</a></sup>.</p>
						<h3>Evidence-based support for PROs in HIV Care</h3>
						<p>PROs have been highly useful to providers and acceptable to patients. An in-depth review of evidence details this here <a href="">[add Dossier link]</a> and supports the idea that implementing PROs in HIV care can:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Improve detection of health behaviors, symptoms, and mental health issues.</li>
							<li>Increase provider awareness and interventions to address depression, drug and alcohol use, intimate partner violence, and other domains in order to improve health outcomes.</li>
							<li>Improve patient-provider communication, by helping patients prioritize and raise concerns, and by helping providers identify and initiate discussion of less-observable issues and/or discussion of topics that are highly sensitive or personal to the patient (e.g., depression, substance use, sexual risk behavior).</li>
							<li>Improve delivery of care, for example, allow providers to focus on the most relevant issues during the visit, increase referrals, more closely monitor treatment, and improve symptom management.</li>
							<li>Improve outcomes such as depression scores and symptom burden.</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>Toolkit purpose</h3>
						<p>This Toolkit provides practical advice to support the introduction of clinical PRO assessments into routine HIV care. These insights draw from a range of sources, including practical experience integrating PROs into HIV clinical care at multiple sites, published literature, and interviews with stakeholders with experience integrating PROs into HIV clinical care. While some of the information in this Toolkit applies to all formats of PRO assessment, we focus on implementation of tablet-based patient self-administered PRO assessments in clinical care due to the clear advantages outlined in <a href="">Chapter 3 [add Chapter 3 link]</a>. Given differences between HIV clinics, a one-size-fits-all approach to PRO integration is unlikely to fit every clinic’s needs. With this in mind, this toolkit provides resources, tips, and effective practices to help implement PROs adapted as needed for individual clinics.</p>

						<h3>Chapter overview: steps toward implementation</h3>
						<p>Though the process of PRO implementation is iterative, the chapters of this Toolkit sequence tasks into a general chronologic order starting with planning and decision-making (Chapters 1-3), then implementation (Chapters 4-6), and finally ongoing collection, maintenance, evaluation and improvement (Chapter 7).</p>
						<p>Chapter 1 helps assess and improve a clinic’s readiness for PRO implementation.</p>
						<p>Chapter 2 offers a pathway for stakeholder engagement. </p>
						<p>Chapter 3 itemizes steps needed in order to build technical infrastructure for electronic data collection. </p>
						<p>Chapter 4 operationalizes important steps to create a PRO assessment that best suits the needs of an individual HIV clinic and its patients. </p>
						<p>Chapter 5 outlines the decisions and protocols to support integration and ongoing success. </p>
						<p>Chapter 6 offers insight into initial and ongoing staff training needs. </p>
						<p>Chapter 7 provides strategies for monitoring, evaluating and sustaining the success of integration of PROs into clinical HIV care.</p>

						<h3>How this Toolkit was developed</h3>
						<p>Evidence and practical tips found in this Toolkit are drawn from real-world PRO implementation experiences and data collected from:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>The PROgress study, a ViiV-funded project evaluating impact, effectiveness, and sustainability of PRO collection in routine clinical HIV care at Midway Specialty Care in Ft. Pierce, FL, and St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, ON. The study and Toolkit were developed in conjunction with a Steering Committee comprised of HIV care providers, people living with HIV (PLWH), and HIV care researchers.</li>
							<li>The Centers for AIDS Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), a network of 8 U.S. HIV clinics. As of early 2020, >85,000 clinical PRO assessments had been completed by >20,000 PLWH across CNICS sites as part of routine clinical care visits to improve care and facilitate research on health domains important to long-term outcomes among PLWH. </li>
						</ol>
						<h3>Language</h3>
						<p>There are a number of acronyms throughout this toolkit. They are defined in Appendix 1. We also define terms that may be unfamiliar or whose meaning differs by context with use. For example, we use the term provider to refer to the physician, fellow, nurse practitioner, physician assistant or other clinician who is providing patient care. We realize in different contexts, terms such as provider have broader or narrower meaning.</p>

						<h2 id="chapter1">CHAPTER 1. ASSESSING AND IMPROVING READINESS TO IMPLEMENT PROs IN HIV CLINICAL CARE</h3>
						
						<h3>Are PROs right for my clinic right now? If not, how do we get there?</h3>
						<p>The appropriateness and readiness of PRO integration in your clinic depends on many factors, including the patient population, needs and perceptions of clinic leadership and providers, logistics, technical capacity, and cost. The tool below is designed to help you assess and improve the feasibility of integrating PROs in your clinic within each of these dimensions, by helping envision how to overcome barriers.</p>
						
						<h3>Patient population:</h3>
						<p>Does the majority of the clinic patient population possess literacy skills to read at the 6th grade level?</p>
						<!--<a class="button fit">Yes</a>
						<a onclick="toggle_visibility_id('q1');" class="button fit">No</a>-->

						<p class="box" id="q1">If “<b>no</b>” (or unsure): PROs that are based on text only may be appropriate for only a subset of the population. An enhancement to text is use of a pre-recorded voice to help guide patients through a brief set of PROs. While this has advantages if reading levels are low, it adds a great deal of time/patient burden to the assessment and therefore should be considered only if needed or only for those patients who need it.</p>
						<p>Does the majority of the clinic patient population possess the cognitive and physical capacity to complete a brief PRO assessment?</p>
						<p class="box">If “<b>no</b>”: self-administered PROs may be less appropriate for these patients, and time may be better spent eliciting verbal self-report or the report of caretakers. Clinic staff may need a consistent means of distinguishing these patients from those with the ability to self-administer PROs. Of note, the ability to complete a brief PRO assessment on a tablet has been found to be feasible in many patient populations including the elderly (particularly if no mouse or keyboard as in tablets)<sup><a href="#REF">25,26</a></sup> and broadly among diverse populations of PLWH<sup><a href="#REF">27,28</a></sup>. This is often much more feasible than expected.</p>
						
						<h3>Clinic leadership:</h3>
						<p>Is the clinic’s leadership likely to support the implementation of PROs?</p>
						<p class="box">If “<b>no</b>”: consider what is driving this perceived lack of support. What are the clinic leadership’s key goals and priorities, and what evidence regarding the use of PROs may align with them? Leadership typically supports PRO implementation for a variety of reasons including improving patient care, better assessing needs, and enabling better data collection for administrative tasks such as mandated reporting and quality assurance from external agencies (See Chapter 2, “Engage Stakeholders”). <a href="">[Add Link to Chapter 2 here]</a></p>
						<p>Is there an individual or individuals on staff that can cultivate stakeholder interest in PRO collection and champion PROs as a priority? Stakeholder support or clinic champions have been critical for successful integration of PROs in clinical care.<sup><a href="#REF">10</a></sup></p>
						<p class="box">If “<b>no</b>”: see Chapter 2, “Engage Stakeholders” which offers support for illustrating the benefits of PROs in clinical care. <a href="">[Add Link to Chapter 2 here]</a></p>
						<p>Is there an individual or individuals on staff that can champion PRO data collection with respect to managing day-to-day operations?</p>
						<p class="box">If “<b>no</b>”: consider what steps would be needed to identify such an individual or allot time in an existing individual’s duties that would be accountable for the ongoing success of this operation. For example, this individual may supervise front desk staff, or may be a designated medical assistant.</p>

						<h3>Providers:</h3>
						<p>Are clinic providers supportive of the use of PRO measures in clinical care?</p>
						<p class="box">If “<b>no</b>”: consider the basis for this. What are their perceptions of the value of PROs? What experiences form their basis for the lack of support? What are their concerns <a href="">(see Chapter 2’s section, “Address Common Concerns” [Link])</a>? Have your providers had negative experiences with PROs? To what extent could these concerns be addressed? Provider concerns often focus on potential impact on clinic flow or visit length. Does focusing on specific, difficult-to-assess domains relevant to improving care, such as substance use or intimate partner violence, impact support? Does focusing on a brief assessment with plans to implement in such a way to minimize impact on flow minimize these concerns?</p>
						<p>Has their response to changes in prior clinic protocols been positive?</p>
						<p class="box">If “<b>no</b>”: identify the key factors driving this. Evidence supporting the benefits of PROs to improve clinical care may minimize these concerns. <a href="">[Add Link to Chapter 2 here]</a></p>

						<h3>Logistics and flow:</h3>
						<p>Can the clinic allot time at the beginning of the visit for patients to take a PRO assessment without disrupting flow?<br><i>Note, amount of time needed will depend on assessment length.</i></p>
						<p class="box">If “<b>no</b>”: do opportunities exist to collect PROs from patients while they are waiting for their provider, or, off-site, using personal electronic devices? <i>Note: while offsite PRO administration may lessen the impact on clinic flow, as a stand-alone approach it excludes patients who lack such devices. It may however be useful as a supplementary approach to within-clinic PRO collection to decrease impact on clinic flow. This may be a particularly useful approach in care settings with Telehealth visits, an increasingly common practice as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. See <a href="">Chapter 5, “Outline Workflow”. [Add Link to Chapter 5 here]</a></i>. A PRO timing estimation tool is available <a href="">here. [Link it]</a></p>
						<p>Does the clinic have a plan to allot space on-site for patients to self-administer a PRO assessment?</p>
						<p class="box">If “<b>no</b>”: can patients complete the PROs while they are waiting for their provider’s in the examination rooms, or off-site? <i>[See above note regarding off-site PRO administration]</i>.</p>

						<h3>Technical capacity:</h3>
						<p>Does the clinic have the technical capacity to support electronic data collection?</p>
						<p class="box">If “<b>no</b>” or “not sure”: see <a href="">Chapter 3, “Building Technical Infrastructure”. [Add Link to Chapter 3 here]</a></p>

						<h3>Cost:</h3>
						<p>Can the clinic afford the resources necessary, such as the staff time and equipment (e.g., iPads or other tablets)?</p>
						<p class="box">If “<b>no</b>” or “not sure”, see the section detailing startup and recurring costs.</p>

						<h3>Startup and recurring costs</h3>
						<p>Understanding the financial costs associated with implementing PROs is fundamental to long-term success. There are different types of costs to consider: initial start-up (or one-time capital costs), and recurring fixed costs.</p>
						<p>Start-up costs bring a project to operational status (e.g., software development, purchase of office equipment, licenses, etc.). These costs incur at the beginning of the project or at a single point in time, and not as a year-to-year or month-to-month expense.</p>
						<p>Table 1 contains typical start-up costs to consider when developing a program budget.</p>
						<div class="table-wrapper">
							<table class="alt">
								<thead>
									<tr>

											<ul>
												<li>Train staff to use PROs, and develop protocol for training new staff</li>
												<li>Establish how PROs will fit into and minimize disruption to clinic flow (e.g., requesting early arrival for patients to take PRO if long assessment or short waiting times; when and how to deliver results to providers)</li>

						</div>

						<p>Of note, some costs (e.g. internet) will not apply to many clinical settings, as these resources are already available. Personnel are likely the most important component of costs in most clinics whether it is adding new staff or reallocating duties. IT costs can include platform development vs. integration of existing platforms (several are available as Shareware but still will require programming <a href="">(see Chapter 3).  [Add Link to Chapter 3 here]</a></p>

						<p>Recurring costs occur on a regular basis, and typically fall within an annual budget period. Unlike one-time costs, recurring costs generally remain the same within the budget year (e.g., general administrative costs, rent, license renewal, etc.). However, normal price increases (e.g., rent increases, pay raises, or other cost-of-living increases) should be budgeted for each coming year. Again, many of these will not apply to many clinic settings however personnel considerations are key.</p>

						<p>One of the biggest issues that lead to delays and practical barriers including unplanned costs with PRO implementation involves integration with the EHR. Creating new platforms can be expensive and time consuming, integrating with EHRs is sometimes not feasible and the burden of the slow and/or complex EHR control processes have been noted as a hurdle1. This is even before taking into account the frequent changes in EHR products that are occurring across many healthcare settings. Fortunately, stand-alone platforms can be used that are much less expensive than developing new platforms, that allow PRO collection to continue regardless of EHR changes and facilitate implementation with PRO feedback even before EHR integration.</p>
						<p class="box tip">Practical tip: A plan regarding technical approaches (Chapter 3) is important when estimating costs. EHR-based approaches are not necessarily the most effective (due to many PLWH not being linked to patient portals), efficient, modifiable, or practical. However, this is a quickly moving area and will need to be assessed on a site-by-site basis <a href="">(Chapter 3). [Add Link to Chapter 3 here]</a></p>

						<h3>Creating a business case for PRO implementation</h3>
						<p>Your organization may require the development of a formal business case for PRO implementation in order to assist in identifying short and long-term goals and associated budget requirements. Needs, solutions, approaches, risk assessments, and value analyses may be included in a business case. Table 3 shows an example of this format.</p>

						<h2 id= "chapter2" >CHAPTER 2.  ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS</h3>
						<h3>Identify stakeholders</h3>
						<p>Early stakeholder engagement facilitates successful PRO implementation and its sustained use. Stakeholders include clinic leadership, patients, providers, and staff, and may also include others, such as hospital administrators or researchers. Each brings unique perspective, concerns, and valuable input. The broad goal of improving care tends to engage stakeholder interest with very specific concrete examples such as identifying otherwise undetectable suicidal ideation, depression, or inadequate adherence to antiretroviral therapy being very relatable goals that almost all stakeholders can appreciate. Furthermore, these types of goals have a strong evidence base supporting their likely success.</p>
						<p>Stakeholder goals may vary. Early, preliminary discussions to understand stakeholder concerns and goals can help tailoring information and helping secure valuable support. For example, providers may be most motivated to adopt PROs to increase the appropriate diagnoses or identification of issues such as inadequate adherence; nurse managers may be concerned with impact on flow; patients may wish PROs included areas such as HIV stigma or social support to provide context to health needs; administrators may want to know if PROs can help satisfy external reporting requirements such as the percentage of clinic patients who complete a mental health instrument. Regardless of the stakeholder or motivation, engagement early in the process can identify and address benefits and concerns around PRO implementation (see section in this chapter, “Addressing Common Concerns”. [Add Link]</p>

						<h3>Prepare demonstration of value</h3> 
						<p>Stakeholder interest depends on clear demonstration of value relative to cost. Ideally, a value demonstration takes the form of a brief presentation, or a simple summary sheet. A presentation demonstrating the impact of PROs on provider awareness and documentation of depression, substance use, and inadequate medication adherence is here<sup><a href="#REF">29</a></sup>. [ADD LINK] While clinical benefits such as increased provider awareness of risk behaviors are relevant for all HIV clinics, additional benefits may be applicable for specific settings (e.g. reporting requirements or meeting annual depression screening requirements for specific state-based payees). Providers have particularly valued improved identification of suicidal ideation and substance use<sup><a href="#REF">30,31</a></sup>.</p>
						<p>In the case of PRO, adoption in the clinical setting, a value demonstration should consider who the beneficiaries are (e.g., the patient, the provider) and what the advantage unique to the stakeholder might be (e.g., better quality patient data for diagnosis, and improved provide/patient interaction, more comprehensive care, improved health outcomes for the patient).</p>

						<p class="box tip"><i>Practical tip: Provide a clear justification for PRO data collection as providers and staff are more likely to support PRO implementation if they understand the value <sup><a href="#REF">1</a></sup>. Short practical examples are more compelling.</i></p>
						<p>Example 1. Improve patient engagement in care via better detection of treatable problems. On average, ~30% of PLWH in the United States report depression at any one time, and this is associated with many poor outcomes such as mortality 2 . It is notable that even among PLWH with known depression there are substantial gaps in the depression treatment cascade with lack of follow up to see if treatments are effective <sup><a href="#REF">3</a></sup>. We plan to integrate a brief clinical assessment of PROs including depression to identify the ~20% of our clinic with undiagnosed or undertreated depression to improve care for those PLWH.</p>
						<p>Example 2. Reduce preventable death. Two patients in the past year were killed as a result of intimate partner violence (IPV). The CDC has estimated that the rate of IPV among women with HIV is double the rate of those without HIV (~55%) 5 . PROs may effectively detect IPV. We are also seeing increasing heroin overdoses. We would like to implement a brief clinical assessment of PROs to allow a standardized approach to screening for IPV, drug and alcohol use, depression and inadequate adherence to allow us to better identify those PLWH in our clinic who may benefit from additional interventions such as addressing IPV and ensuring Narcan for those using illicit opioids.</p>

						<h3>Meet with stakeholders</h3>
						<p>Meeting with diverse stakeholders as a group presents an opportunity to describe the purpose of PROs, alleviate concerns or misapprehensions, and to coalesce support for their known value in improving care and clinical outcomes.9 An adaptable sample presentation for this purpose is here. [Add Link here]</p>
						<p>Beyond the presentation of static information, we recommend giving stakeholders the opportunity in this meeting to interact with PRO measures and their output in order to better understand the process and its potential. This step, in our experience, has been a key turning point in generating enthusiasm and helping stakeholders visualize integration into daily routine. An example of an electronically administered touch-screen PRO assessment for this purpose is here, [Add Link here] which your audience may self-administer on their own or other devices. Sample output, or the results generated for providers is here [Add Link here] and in Figure 6 (Chapter 4). An interactive tool for determining average timing to completion for varied combinations of individual PRO measures is here. [Add Link here] Screenshots of the interactive tool can also be found in Appendix 2.</p>
						<p>Figure 2 shows a sample agenda for an initial meeting with stakeholders.</p>

						<p class="box" style="background-color: grey;">Figure 2: Sample initial stakeholder meeting agenda
							<br><br>Initial orientation to PROs:
							<ul>
								<li>PROs-introduction, definition</li>
								<li>History/current status of PRO science</li>
								<li>Reasons to use PROs- clinical/research value, reduces social desirability bias</li>
								<li>Advantages computer-based, patient self-administration</li>
								<li>PROs: common measurable domains of HIV care</li>
								<li>iPad or other tablet demo of PROs: what patients see</li>
								<li>Delivery of results: what providers see</li>
								<li>Potential for electronic alerts in real time for intimate partner violence (IPV), suicidal ideation, other alerts</li>
								<li>Evidence detailing elements of successful implementation; reasons for prior failures</li>
								<li>Discussion: thoughts, concerns, potential for integration into clinic</li>
							</ul>
							Further discussion could include:
							<ul>
								<li>Integrating PROs into clinic flow</li>
								<li>Integrating PROs into EHR</li>
								<li>Concerns, questions, identification of opportunities for using PROs to improve workflow/effectiveness
								with patients</li>
								<li>Opportunities for the use of aggregate PRO data</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<p>A sample presentation for this purpose is here [Link] and Appendix 3.</p>

						<h3>Provide overview of value</h3>
						<p class="box tip">Practical tip: Bring tablets and a demonstration version. Showing how straight forward it is for PLWH to complete, and how straight forward it is to get PLWH started with an assessment is crucial to alleviate staff concerns. Shorten the agenda as needed to ensure adequate time for the demonstration.</p>

						<h3>Initial training</h3>
						<p>A general overview of the PROs and their value will be relevant to all involved, with specific training elements relevant to the execution of individual roles.</p>
						<p>Figure 7 shows a sample training agenda covering the topics necessary to equip staff and providers to begin administering PROs. This may be broken up into more than one training, such as one for orienting to PROs in general, and another detailing or developing protocols; or, for training different levels of staff. In our experience, initial trainings that include all staff types work well, particularly for smaller clinics. The training becomes a dynamic and iterative process in which staff members in different roles collaboratively think through how patients administered PROs will move through their visit, refining protocols in the process. </p>
						<p>PRO output given to providers should be easy enough to interpret that no specialized training is needed.</p>
						<h3>Ongoing Training</h3>
						<p>Consider providing refresher training or process checks as time goes on to ensure that the process is operating optimally. Options include observation by another staff member or a formal refresher session.</p>
						<p class="box tip">Practical Tip: If the clinic has an orientation manual for new hires, include a short paragraph about the PRO process
						<br><br>
						Practical Tip: Having staff complete a demonstration PRO assessment on the tablet can quickly demonstrate how easy it is and greatly decrease hurdles
						<br><br>
						Practical Tip: While formal refresher sessions are one option to provide ongoing training and maintain enthusiasm, we have found that annual brief presentations of key findings (e.g. % of PLWH reporting depression, methamphetamine use, etc.) to the entire staff (as part of quarterly staff and provider joint meetings) has resulted in ownership and ongoing support not just from the providers but also from other staff members.</p>
