									<h3 id="toc">What Is the Purpose of the Implementation Toolkit?</h3>
									<p>This toolkit has been designed to support PRO uptake in routine HIV care by highlighting key considerations for implementers; this includes implementation insights, example materials and testimonies from stakeholders who have first-hand experience with PRO implementation, covering key areas that need to be actioned or assessed. The objective is to facilitate easier and more effective PRO use where appropriate.</p>
									<p>Much of the real world evidence and practical tips found in the Toolkit are drawn from conversations with staff from the Center for Aids Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS).  CNICS is an electronic medical records-based network of HIV clinics.  It provides a research infrastructure to support research on HIV clinical outcomes and comparative effectiveness trials.  CNICS sites include routine collection of PROs electronically as part of their clinical care (see, for example, Crane et al. 2017; Fredericksen et al. 2012; Fredericksen et al. 2016).<p>
									<h3>What Steps Are Needed for PRO Implementation?</h3>
									<p>PRO implementation involves several stages of planning and execution, as well as follow-up and assessment. Each chapter in the toolkit considers a different step in the implementation process. The order in which the steps are followed depends on the needs of the individual clinic. The chapters available in this resource are outlined below:</p>
									
									<h4><a href="#chapter1"> Chapter 1: Choosing PROs and Implementation Approaches to Meet Patient and Clinic Needs</a></h4>
									<p>The focus of this chapter is the appropriate selection of PROs based on clinic’s needs and their HIV patient population; it includes links to available PROs and a discussion of the administration, scoring, and interpretation process</p>
										<ul class="actions stacked">
											<li><a href="#chapter1" id="PDF" class="button smooth-scroll-middle">Jump to Chapter 1</a></li>
										</ul>
								
									<h4>Chapter 2: Obtaining Stakeholder Buy-in</h4>
									<p>The focus of this chapter is on identifying stakeholders who are critical to implementing PROs in an HIV clinic, the information stakeholders need to provide buy-in, and considerations for approaching stakeholders</p>
										<ul class="actions stacked">
											<li><a href="#chapter2" id="PDF" class="button smooth-scroll-middle">Jump to Chapter 2</a></li>
										</ul>

									<h4>Chapter 3: Making the Business Case for PRO Implementation</h4>
									<p>This focus of this chapter is on building a compelling case to secure funding or endorsement of the program</p>
										<ul class="actions stacked">
											<li><a href="#chapter3" id="PDF" class="button smooth-scroll-middle">Jump to Chapter 3</a></li>
										</ul>
									
									<h4>Chapter 4: Building PRO Infrastructure</h4>
									<p>The focus of this chapter is on setting up the PROs to be administered electronically and the potential approaches connecting the electronic PRO (ePRO) system to the electronic health records as well as key considerations for IT</p>
										<ul class="actions stacked">
											<li><a href="#chapter4" id="PDF" class="button smooth-scroll-middle">Jump to Chapter 4</a></li>
										</ul>
									
									<h4>Chapter 5: Integrating PROs into Clinic Care Settings</h4>
									<p>The focus of this chapter is the integration of the PRO system into the clinic flow including considerations of when and where to administer the PROs</p>
										<ul class="actions stacked">
											<li><a href="#chapter5" id="PDF" class="button smooth-scroll-middle">Jump to Chapter 5</a></li>
										</ul>
									<h4>Chapter 6: Training Clinic Personnel</h4>
									<p>The focus of this chapter is on training the various staff on what they need to know about the PRO implementation and how they may engage with patients</p>
										<ul class="actions stacked">
											<li><a href="#chapter6" id="PDF" class="button smooth-scroll-middle">Jump to Chapter 6</a></li>
										</ul>
									<h4>Chapter 7: Monitoring and Evaluation</h4>
									<p>The focus of this chapter is how to monitor, evaluate and update the PRO system used in a clinic</p>
										<ul class="actions stacked">
											<li><a href="#chapter7" id="PDF" class="button smooth-scroll-middle">Jump to Chapter 7</a></li>
										</ul>
																
									<p>All chapters where possible include comments from stakeholders and practical tips from implementers.</p>
									<h3>What Other Guides Are Available?</h3>
									<p>This toolkit was developed specifically for implementation of PROs in HIV routine care. Other more general guides exist, and provide somewhat different—though useful—information. These include the “Users Guide to Implementing Patient-Reported Outcomes Assessments in Clinical Practice” by the International Society for Quality of Life Research (ISOQOL) (Version 2, 2015), and the results of a workshop held by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) in 2013.</p>
									<p>The ISOQOL guide focuses on the PROs, the types, timing of administration, score assessment and presentation and evaluation of use. The current document provides broader information on identification of stakeholders, finance, training, information technology (IT) issues, monitoring, and evaluation. The PCORI document summarizes a far-ranging workshop, and provides recommendations in areas of infrastructure/shared resources, as well as recommendations for methods and health systems.</p>

						<h2>CHAPTER 4.  CREATE PRO ASSESSMENT</h2>
						<p>content</p>

						<h3>Decide mode of administration</h3>
						<p>Decision-making tool would be useful here. Decisions: electronic, paper, staff vs self guided; remotely completed on own device vs. on-site.</p>

						<h3>Select PROs: attributes to consider</h3>
						<p>Decision-making tool assessing the appropriateness of individual measures to their clinic population would be useful here. Another useful tool would be to electronically build their own mock assessment (with the goal of determining likely time/content burden on the patient). Could be created by stacking domains, rather than including individual items.
						<br>
						[Characteristics: brief, clinically relevant, ideally non-proprietary, validated, literacy level, interpretable by providers (scoring), consideration of overall session time; determine what order measures are asked (e.g., less sensitive content first); format in which measures are being asked (in person vs electronic).]</p>
						<p>Here's a preview of the interactive survey time estimator</p> 
						<p>option 1</p>

						<h3>Determine PRO administration algorithms</h3>
						<p>Refers to frequency of administration of individual measures, as well as frequency of administering overall PROs. Decision-making tool may be possible here; could be part of the build-own-mock-PRO idea that shows how PROs could look at different timepoints.</p>

						<h3>Format Results</h3>
						<p>This section provides guidance for developing provider feedback of PRO results including examples, scoring considerations, interpretability emphasized. A tool that helps them build a mock version of their own would be useful here.</p>

						<h3>Typical PRO workflows</h3>
						<p>Supported by figures/graphics. We want readers to visualize what’s possible prior to getting into the details. Will compare workflows that are more productive vs. less productive in our experience.</p>

						<h3>Action Item</h3>
						<p>Tool: “To do” checklist</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Define staff roles and centralize responsiblity</li>
							<li>Develop protocols</li>
							<ul>
								<li>When and where to complete PROs: More granular level decision than in Chapter 4: Before appointment? If so how much longer before? During appointment? On site? If so, where? Off site remotely? Some remote and some on site? Etc.</li>
								<li>How to introducce PROs to Patients: Provide script/language as the ‘tool’ for this</li>
								<li>Whether to administer PROs</li>
								<ul>
									<li>Person attributes: Focus on when NOT to administer. Ex: low literacy level, poor cognitive function, acute illness.</li>
									<li>Flow-related attributes: Ex: patient late, taking too long to answer; busy clinic day with no space or time.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>How to deliver results: timing, format</li>
								<li>Emergency and high-rosk protocols: Emergency: Suicide, IPV; at risk: poor adherence, drug use, depression, sexual risk behavior</li>
							</ul>
							<li>Pilot: Explains how to pilot in phases (staff as mock patient, then amenable real patient)</li>
							<li>Launch: Explains what initial day, subsequent days may look like; what things have come up during this time in our experience, what resources needed etc.</li>
