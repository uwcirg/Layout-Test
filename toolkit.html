									<h2>Implementation Toolkit</h2>
								</header>
								<div class="content">
									<h3>What Is the Purpose of the Implementation Toolkit?</h3>
									<p>This toolkit has been designed to support PRO uptake in routine HIV care by highlighting key considerations for implementers; this includes implementation insights, example materials and testimonies from stakeholders who have first-hand experience with PRO implementation, covering key areas that need to be actioned or assessed. The objective is to facilitate easier and more effective PRO use where appropriate.</p>
									<p>Much of the real world evidence and practical tips found in the Toolkit are drawn from conversations with staff from the Center for Aids Research (CFAR) Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS).  CNICS is an electronic medical records-based network of HIV clinics.  It provides a research infrastructure to support research on HIV clinical outcomes and comparative effectiveness trials.  CNICS sites include routine collection of PROs electronically as part of their clinical care (see, for example, Crane et al. 2017; Fredericksen et al. 2012; Fredericksen et al. 2016).<p>
									<h3>What Steps Are Needed for PRO Implementation?</h3>
									<p>PRO implementation involves several stages of planning and execution, as well as follow-up and assessment. Each chapter in the toolkit considers a different step in the implementation process. The order in which the steps are followed depends on the needs of the individual clinic. The chapters available in this resource are outlined below:</p>
									
									<h4>Chapter 1: Choosing PROs and Implementation Approaches to Meet Patient and Clinic Needs</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>The focus of this chapter is the appropriate selection of PROs based on clinic’s needs and their HIV patient population; it includes links to available PROs and a discussion of the administration, scoring, and interpretation process</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>Chapter 2: Obtaining Stakeholder Buy-in</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>The focus of this chapter is on identifying stakeholders who are critical to implementing PROs in an HIV clinic, the information stakeholders need to provide buy-in, and considerations for approaching stakeholders</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>Chapter 3: Making the Business Case for PRO Implementation</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>This focus of this chapter is on building a compelling case to secure funding or endorsement of the program</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>Chapter 4: Building PRO Infrastructure</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>The focus of this chapter is on setting up the PROs to be administered electronically and the potential approaches connecting the electronic PRO (ePRO) system to the electronic health records as well as key considerations for IT</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>Chapter 5: Integrating PROs into Clinic Care Settings</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>The focus of this chapter is the integration of the PRO system into the clinic flow including considerations of when and where to administer the PROs</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>Chapter 6: Training Clinic Personnel</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>The focus of this chapter is on training the various staff on what they need to know about the PRO implementation and how they may engage with patients</li>
									</ul>
									<h4>Chapter 7: Monitoring and Evaluation</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>The focus of this chapter is how to monitor, evaluate and update the PRO system used in a clinic</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>What Other Guides Are Available?</h3>
									<p>This toolkit was developed specifically for implementation of PROs in HIV routine care. Other more general guides exist, and provide somewhat different—though useful—information. These include the “Users Guide to Implementing Patient-Reported Outcomes Assessments in Clinical Practice” by the International Society for Quality of Life Research (ISOQOL) (Version 2, 2015), and the results of a workshop held by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) in 2013.</p>
									<p>The ISOQOL guide focuses on the PROs, the types, timing of administration, score assessment and presentation and evaluation of use. The current document provides broader information on identification of stakeholders, finance, training, information technology (IT) issues, monitoring, and evaluation. The PCORI document summarizes a far-ranging workshop, and provides recommendations in areas of infrastructure/shared resources, as well as recommendations for methods and health systems.</p>
