						<p>The PROgress project, “<i>Improving HIV Care Through The Implementation Of PROs within Routine Patient Management</i>,” is a <b>ViiV Healthcare sponsored research workstream</b> in collaboration with the University of Washington. The goal of the project is to collate and supplement evidence, insights and resources that can support the implementation of patient reported outcomes and measures (PROs) within routine HIV care.</p>
							
						<p>PROgress included work on three core interrelated components:
							<br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The PROgress North American Site Study:</b> This is an implementation science study of the integration of PROs in routine care within two North American HIV outpatient clinics.</li>
							<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The PROgress Implementation Toolkit:</b> This is a practical resource developed for health care practitioners considering the implementation of PROs within routine clinical HIV care. </li>
							<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The PROgress Evidence Review and Summary:</b> This collates evidence relevant to PROs in the care of PLWH, highlighting the potential of a well implemented process within routine HIV care to benefit PLHIV, providers and clinics. </li>
						</p>
						<p>Each were designed as complementary outputs of PROgress, to support future HIV practice.</p>
						<p>This website is a collation of outputs from PROgress, drawing upon the expertise and insights of patients, providers, and researchers involved in the workstream.</p>

							<h3 id="about">What are PROs?</h3>	
							<p>In the context of this evidence review, we focus on brief PRO assessments useful for clinical care, typically but not always collected on touch-screen tablets at the start of clinic appointments to improve care with summary results made available to providers for the clinic visit. Other approaches are also possible such as interviewer-based collection or electronic health record patient portals; however, we emphasize these much less due to the high costs, staff burden, and under-reporting of risk behaviors with interviewer-based approaches, and the exclusion of so many potentially high-risk patients with patient portals that require a level of technological sophistication and access that is not inclusive of entire HIV clinic populations.</p>
							<p>Patient reported outcome measures, or PROs, gather patients’ assessments and experiences of clinically important issues, typically through brief, validated questionnaires. PROs offer insight beyond what may be directly observable by the provider in several dimensions of care.</p>
							<span class="image fit">
								<img data-src="images/PROS-care.png" alt="PROs may include one or more dimensions of care: physical symptoms; mental health (e.g, depression, anxiety); health behaviors (e.g., medication adherence, substance use, sexual risk behavior); functioning (e.g., cognitive, physical); life circumstances (e.g., current housing, nutrition, family history of chronic illness, intimate partner violence); identity (e.g., sexual orientation, gender identity); social well-being (e.g., social support, HIV stigma); health-related quality of life (HRQL); and patient satisfaction with care." />
							</span>
							<p>On-site PRO collection prior to routine clinical care appointments, via hand-held computer tablets with real-time results available to providers during clinic visits, has improved provider ability to detect and address depression/suicidal ideation, inadequate antiretroviral (ART) adherence, and substance use in HIV care <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">1,2</a></sup> . Integrating PROs into clinical care of patients with chronic conditions, such as HIV, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, have also been shown to be acceptable to patients and providers and valuable in clinical care <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">2-4</a></sup> ; they have improved patient-provider communication <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">5-9</a></sup> and increased patient satisfaction with care <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">8,10-12</a></sup>.</p>

							<h2 id="provider">The Value For HIV Providers</h2>
							<h3>Improve identification of health issues and behaviors through improved patient-provider communication</h3>
							<p>PROs have been valuable in helping providers detect previously unrecognized problems <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">1,2</a></sup>. Controlled trials have found PROs improve provider ability to identify highly personal or stigmatizing symptoms or behaviors, including suicidal ideation, depression <sup><a href=#ref">1,13</a></sup> , substance use <sup><a href=#ref">1</a></sup> ,inadequate ART adherence <sup><a href=#ref">1</a></sup> , and sexual behavior <sup><a href=#ref">14</a></sup> . PROs have also improved detection of a broad range of symptoms in several clinical populations <sup><a href=#ref">7,15-20</a></sup> as well as less-observable quality-of-life issues, such as social functioning <sup><a href=#ref">5,8,14,21</a></sup>.</p>
							<h3>Improve patient health outcomes</h3>
							<p>Evidence suggests the use of PROs has contributed to improved health outcomes including fewer emergency department visits and hospitalizations <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">22,23</a></sup> , increased survival rates among cancer patients <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">22,23</a></sup> , improved outcomes for mental health conditions <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">24</a></sup> , lower symptom distress <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">16,17,25</a></sup> and better health-related quality of life <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">7</a></sup> .</p>
							<h3>Workflow impact</h3>
							<p>Providers reported PROs allowed for more comprehensive identification of issues and concerns that was generally regarded as an additional but manageable impact on workflow that was regarded as a valuable tradeoff. Both patients and providers described high acceptability of PROs in routine care and high added value.</p>

							<h3>Optimize your care</h3>
							<p>Patients living with HIV have found the use of PROs improved communication with their provider in a number of ways. Specifically, it has 1) offered an opportunity to take inventory of current health needs, symptoms, health behaviors, and quality of life, including mental health and social well-being, improving their ability to advocate for their needs; 2) offered a preview in advance of the appointment of potential topics for discussion; and 3) helped patients to initiate, structure and prioritize discussion topics with their provider. 4) enabled easier discussion of sensitive or highly personal topics, such as mental health, sexual health, and substance use.<sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">28</a></sup> .</p>

The iPad is not going to look at you because you say you do crack every day, it&#39;s not going to do that…. so you can be a lot more open when you&#39;re doing it with the iPad by yourself. So…if you don&#39;t feel comfortable talking to a doctor about it at first it&#39;s a lot easier at least when they come in [with the iPad PRO results] and they already know. <br>-(Patient, Ft. Pierce, FL)</td>

																	<td>[If] you look at someone and they're clearly distraught, maybe tearful and that sort of thing, you can engage in questions around that. But as everyone knows… you can mask that stuff very easily. People do it all the time every day. And unless prompted or asked specifically around depression and suicidal ideation, people won't admit to it…there's also a big stigma and shame around mental health issues. So unless it was very obvious … I wouldn't [have asked]. And in these cases, these are literally people that I don't think I would have flagged...at the end of the day, the best element of this tool is, if nothing else, it helps us engage in a topic or conversation that would be awkward otherwise.<br>-(Physician, Toronto)</td>
																	<td>I find that it's easier to answer to an iPad than it is to a person. I found certain questions, like the alcohol question, I was a little more honest about on the iPad versus [in person]– because I feel like you're expecting a judgmental look back, even though my doctor is actually extremely great no matter what I've done –or not done. [Answering PROs on an iPad] takes away from that,– because [results are] on a sheet of paper, someone else is going to make their look while they're reading it, so you don't have to see it. You don't have to acknowledge it.<br>-(Patient, Toronto)</td>

							<p style="text-align: left;">PROs cover a broad range of topics clinically relevant to patients living with HIV, including symptoms, mental health, health behaviors, basic needs, social context, and quality of life. A resulting report summarizes results and displays topics of interest in order of clinical priority, and can depict changes over time. Alerts for critical issues such as significant anxiety or distress, interference with function, or suicidal ideation, may be sent to an appropriate provider or displayed to the patient, depending on whether the patient is within or outside a clinical setting when using the PROs. The following are just a sample of PRO measures, and is non-exhaustive.

							<h2 id="toolkit">PROgress Implementation Toolkit</h2>
							<p>The PROgress Implementation Toolkit provides practical advice to support the introduction of clinical PRO assessments into routine HIV care. These insights draw from a range of sources, including practical experience integrating PROs into HIV clinical care, published literature, and primary interviews with stakeholders with experience integrating PROs into HIV clinical care. Its focus is on implementation of tablet-based patient self-administered PRO assessments in clinical care yet many of the lessons are applicable across different types of applications. The toolkit includes information on: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Assessing clinic readiness and preparing for PRO implementation</li>
								<li>Stakeholder engagement strategies</li>
								<li>Building and/or selecting technical infrastructure for electronic data collection</li>
								<li>Creating a PRO assessment that best suits the needs of your clinic and its patients, <a href="toolkit.html#time"><b>including an online time-budget tool</b></a> to minimize patient response burden and impact on clinic flow</li>
								<li>PRO integration and sustainability success</li>
								<li>Staff training needs</li>
								<li>Monitoring and evaluating successful PRO integration</li>

							<h2 id="evidence">PROgress Evidence Review and Summary</h2>
							
							<p>An evidence summary document has been collated to raise awareness of the potential value of well implemented PRO instruments within routine HIV care. It draws upon evidence from published literature characterizing the impact of PROs in routine clinical care for patients with chronic comorbidities, including HIV-related literature as well as other fields, particularly oncology. It includes real-world evidence surrounding the impact on patient outcomes, care processes, and the usability and acceptability of PRO platforms.</p>

							<h2 id="study">PROgress North American Site Study Summary</h2>
							
							<p>The PROgress study implemented patient-reported measures and outcomes (PROs) in two HIV outpatient clinical care settings to answer two overarching research questions:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>What is the added value of implementing PROs into routine HIV care for the salient stakeholders, including the patient, the providers, and other clinic staff?</li>
								<li>What are the essential program elements that can improve the sustainable adoption and implementation of PROs into routine HIV care across a range of differently resourced clinics?</li>
							</ol>
							<p>The two North American outpatient HIV care clinics were: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Midway Specialty Care Center, Fort Pierce, Florida, USA.</li>
								<li>St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The PRO assessments included measures of symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety), behaviors (e.g. adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART), substance use), and other circumstances and perspectives (e.g., housing status, intimate partner violence, HIV medication satisfaction). </p>
							<p>Using an implementation science framework (RE-AIM) and a mixed methodology quantitative and qualitative approach, we sought effectiveness and implementation insights. Data collection included 1761 completed patient PROs, 600 chart reviews, 47 qualitative interviews, 200 patient questionnaires, 17 provider questionnaires, training evaluations and a significant volume of implementation data and insights.</p>
							<p>RESULTS:<br>
							Reporting of the results will be made available on this website as we publish our findings in peer reviewed journals and at conferences. These will also be integrated into the PROgress Evidence Review and Summary</p>
