							<h3>What are PROs?</h3>
							<p>Patient reported outcome measures, or PROs, elicit the patient’s assessment and experience of clinically important issues, using brief, validated questionnaires. PRO measures offer insight beyond what may be directly observable by the provider in several dimensions of care. These include: physical symptoms; mental health (e.g, depression, anxiety); health behaviors (e.g., medication adherence, substance use, sexual risk behavior); functioning (e.g., cognitive, physical); life circumstances (e.g., current housing, nutrition, family history of chronic illness, intimate partner violence); identity (e.g., sexual orientation, gender identity); social well-being (e.g., social support, HIV stigma); health-related quality of life (HRQL); and patient satisfaction with care. 
								<br><br>
								On-site PRO collection prior to routine clinical care appointments, via hand-held computer tablets with real-time results available to providers during clinic visits, has improved provider ability to detect and address depression/suicidal ideation, inadequate antiretroviral (ART) adherence, and substance use in HIV care <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">1,2</a></sup> . Integrating PROs into clinical care of patients with chronic conditions, such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and HIV, have been shown to be acceptable to patients and providers and valuable in clinical care <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">2-4</a></sup> ; they have improved patient-provider communication <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">5-9</a></sup> and increased patient satisfaction with care <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">8,10-12</a></sup> .

Their support financed the PROgress Study, which evaluated the process of implementing electronic PROs in routine outpatient HIV care, as well as their utility, usability, acceptability, and impact. We thank the patients, providers, and research staff from two PROgress Study clinics, Midway Specialty Care in Ft. Pierce, FL, and St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, ON, for their rich insights and commitment to this work. We thank the staff of the Ontario HIV Treatment Network and affiliated clinics for their continued collaborative partnership in advancing the role of PROs in HIV care. We also thank the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), and the University of Washington Clinical Informatics Research Group (CIRG), for provision of resources and expertise in development of this website. Finally, we thank the PROgress Study Steering Committee, comprised of an expert panel of patients living with HIV, HIV care providers, clinic directors, and health care researchers, for their oversight and guidance.

							<h3>Improve identification of health issues and behaviors</h3>
							<p>PROs have been valuable in helping providers detect previously unrecognized problems <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">1,2</a></sup>. Controlled trials have found PROs improve provider ability to identify highly personal or stigmatizing symptoms or behaviors, including suicidal ideation, depression <sup><a href=#ref">1,13</a></sup> , substance use <sup><a href=#ref">1</a></sup> ,inadequate ART adherence <sup><a href=#ref">1</a></sup> , and sexual behavior <sup><a href=#ref">14</a></sup> . PROs have also improved detection of a broad range of symptoms in several clinical populations <sup><a href=#ref">7,15-20</a></sup> as well as less-observable quality-of-life issues, such as social functioning <sup><a href=#ref">5,8,14,21</a></sup>.</p>
							<h3>Improve patient health outcomes</h3>
							<p>Evidence suggests the use of PROs has contributed to improved health outcomes including fewer emergency department visits and hospitalizations <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">22,23</a></sup> , increased survival rates among cancer patients <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">22,23</a></sup> , improved outcomes for mental health conditions <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">24</a></sup> , lower symptom distress <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">16,17,25</a></sup> and better health-related quality of life <sup><a href="#ref" class="smooth-scroll-top">7</a></sup> .</p>

							<p>This website was made possible by funding from ViiV Healthcare Limited, a subsidiary of GlaxoSmithKline Mercury Limited. Their support financed the PROgress Study, which evaluated the process of implementing electronic PROs in routine outpatient HIV care, as well as their utility, usability, acceptability, and impact. We thank the patients, providers, and research staff from two PROgress Study clinics, Midway Specialty Care in Ft. Pierce, FL, and St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto, ON, for their rich insights and commitment to this work. We thank the staff of the Ontario HIV Treatment Network and affiliated clinics for their continued collaborative partnership in advancing the role of PROs in HIV care. We also thank the Centers for AIDS Research Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS), and the University of Washington Clinical Informatics Research Group (CIRG), for provision of resources and expertise in development of this website. Finally, we thank the PROgress Study Steering Committee, comprised of an expert panel of patients living with HIV, HIV care providers, clinic directors, and health care researchers, for their oversight and guidance.
