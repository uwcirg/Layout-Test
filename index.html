							<p class="major"> <i>What are PROs?</i><br>
							Patient reported outcome measures, or PROs, elicit the patient’s assessment and experience of clinically important issues, using brief, validated questionnaires. PRO measures offer insight beyond what may be directly observable by the provider in several dimensions of care. These include: physical symptoms; mental health (e.g, depression, anxiety); health behaviors (e.g., medication adherence, substance use, sexual risk behavior); functioning (e.g., cognitive, physical); life circumstances (e.g., current housing, nutrition, family history of chronic illness, intimate partner violence); identity (e.g., sexual orientation, gender identity); social well-being (e.g., social support, HIV stigma); health-related quality of life (HRQL); and patient satisfaction with care. 
								<br><br>
								On-site PRO collection prior to routine clinical care appointments, via hand-held computer tablets with real-time results available to providers during clinic visits, has improved provider ability to detect and address depression/suicidal ideation, inadequate antiretroviral (ART) adherence, and substance use in HIV care 1,2 . Integrating PROs into clinical care of patients with chronic conditions, such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and HIV, have been shown to be acceptable to patients and providers and valuable in clinical care 2-4 ; they have improved patient-provider communication 5-9 and increased patient satisfaction with care 8,10-12 .

Specifically, it has 1) offered an opportunity to take inventory of current health needs, symptoms, health behaviors, and quality of life, including mental health and social well-being, improving their ability to advocate for their needs; 2) offered a preview in advance of the appointment of potential topics for discussion; and 3) enabled easier discussion of sensitive or highly personal topics, such as mental health, sexual health, and substance use. <sup><a href="#ref">28</a></sup> .</p>

							<h2 id="three">Clinical Topics Measured by PROs</h2>
							<p>PROs cover a broad range of topics clinically relevant to patients living with HIV, including symptoms, mental health, health behaviors, basic needs, social context, and quality of life. A resulting report summarizes results and displays topics of interest in order of clinical priority, and can depict changes over time. Alerts for critical issues such as significant anxiety or distress, interference with function, or suicidal ideation, may be sent to an appropriate provider or displayed to the patient, depending on whether the patient is within or outside a clinical setting when using the PROs.
